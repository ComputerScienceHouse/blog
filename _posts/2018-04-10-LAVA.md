## Background
I decided to make L.A.V.A. after a bunch of different (failed) interations. I knew I wanted my major project this year to be something that worked with Arduino's and my friend showed me this really cool project that used a whole bunch of things-and I was in WAAY over my head. Before December I had never touched an Arduino before. Before Spring break, I'd never coded in C++ before (I did have some C# experience, but not entirely applicable). I'm still amazed I was able to do this-and it works! 

## L.A.V.A

L.A.V.A uses an arduino uno rev3, some jumper wires, a fully addressable LED light strip, a card that detects sound input, a trimpot for brightness control, three buttons; one to change the colour pallete, one to change the visualization effect, and then one that randomizes both a colour and visulization effect, and a lot of code.

I used the NeoPixel library to make working with the LED light strand super easy, but essentially what happens, is the mic is actively listening and picking up the "beat" of the song, which determines the visulization pattern (not the colour). This "beat" is put into a loop and replays over and over until a different "beat" or "bump" is detected, creating a new repeating loop. I coded 4 visulization effects:
    1: Pulse- the basic visulation, just pulses from the center of the strand. All LEDS are all ONE colour in this one
    2: PalettePulse- the second most basic. Just allows for a "gradient" to be applied to the LED strand while pulsing to the beat of the sound.
    3: PaletteDance-the whole gradient oscillates to the beat, similar to a snake, and holy code a moley. Got confused on this one a few times
    4: Glitter-(currently not working)creates a white sparkle on the palette to match the beat...but it's broken ATM.
    
I have 6 different gradients that I made up for the project-there's nothing really specially about this part, it just returns RGBs in a pretty pattern. I choose not to make any static gradients, but it is possible if you wish to do so.

In an effort to add more functionality, I used a trimpot to be able to adjust the brightness of the lights. However, I'm not entirely sure it's working and it's something I hope to revisit in the future!

Here's a link to the full repository for the code: https://github.com/blackroses9995/LAVA/blob/master/LAVA.ino

TL;DR: The project is a strand of fully addressable LEDs that lgiht up to the beat of the song, wrapped around an image laser etched into an acrylic sheet. Looks cool man, I swear.


## Future Plans

This was definitely a labour of love (and confusion), but for the future, I'd love to make more visulization effects and possibly hang a permanment one on floor somewhere for all to enjoy (perhaphs with a remote control....:thinking-face:). I tried to do something I called "splatter", which would be kind of like glitter, but instead of a white dot, it would throw colour on that portion of the gradient. You know, like a paint splatter. But it didn't work... Just like my trimpot.
