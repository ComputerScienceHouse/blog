I spent a long time reading HTML and CSS documentation just so I could figure out how flexible I could be with the language.  This had to be the most fun part of the project because the documentation was so easy to read and figure out and the [Tutorials Point HTML Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/index.htm) as well as the [Tutorials Point CSS Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/index.htm) definitely also helped.

After I read through all the things that HTML and CSS had to offer, I wrote the home page with and then realized I needed a server to run it.  I decided to use [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html) as the server and getting Spark to work was a big challenge that I had to face just because the documentation doesn't help, and there was essentially no help online on how to install it correctly on IntelliJ.

Once I got Spark to work, I put my HTML, CSS, and Spark server together and started my Version Control on Git.  I then created the backend with Java and started connecting the frontend and backend together. I got my program to make the buttons on my HTML page send information to store in my backend, however it was difficult to post the information back into the frontend and this turned out to be my second biggest problem.  I ended up having to use a tiny bit of JavaScript to get it working.

I still have a couple of enhancements to do, such as using a database so when the server is restarted, information on my backend won't be wiped out.  I could also make it so people can drag ideas from the Envision Projects table to the Current Dabbling table for user satisfaction.  I could also fix some of the bugs I have in my code such as the potential problems my site would have running on an older web browser.

Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project as this was my first real personal project that I've done and I'm ecstatic about it!
