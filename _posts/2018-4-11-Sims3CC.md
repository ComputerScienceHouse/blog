## Summary

Sims custom content has been around for a while and there is a plethora of it on the internet. But despite the quantity of content on the internet there is relatively little documentation of how to create such thing for yourself. So as a person with a background with 3D modeling this seemed like an easy pursuit. My goal was to simply create several clothing pieces to be fully function in sims3.
##Required software
Up front I learned that there was a lot of software tools needed, the first one being TSR workshop which allowed you extract from the game. Then there was Milkshape3D which allowed for importing/exporting of models from the game to other software and the Sims3 Mesh Toolkit which rigs the mesh and creates morphs. Then, of course, there is the modeling software and image editor you want to use.

## My Process

I used TSR workshop to export an outfit similar to what I wanted to create, then I converted it for use in my modeling software. I spent the next couple of hours creating the mesh and base texture for the object. Once I was satisfied with how it looked, I went to reimport it. Reimporting is the hard step, I ran the object through milkshape to sort out the materials and, on my first object, I did my rigging here. Manual rigging in milkshape seems to be alternative to the Toolkit if it doesnâ€™t work, but for my other objects I used the Toolkit. Then I loaded all objects back into TSR workshop. TSR workshop is the most confusing of programs and it is where I messed up my model several times. All the textures have very specific parameters for how they need to be done or else it messes up how it displays in-game. This is what took me the longest to figure out and in doing research here I learned a lot about how sims3 optimizes its textures and how recolorable channels work. But eventually I got things sorted out and my Items working in the game.
