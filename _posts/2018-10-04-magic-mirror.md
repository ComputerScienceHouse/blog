This project is the design, manufacturing and assembly of a Magic Mirror. 
A magic mirror is a device that utilizes a two-way mirror and a monitor to display information on a screen while still reflecting an image with a much better quality than just using a camera could provide. 
The mirror measures “_” x “_” and was created over the course of a month. 
The mirror also utilizes a raspberry pi to run control the mirror and uses Raspbian OS. The raspberry pi is running an open-source, modular, smart mirror platform called MagicMirror2.  
Because the project is open-source and modular, many other features besides the default installation features are available to add to the mirror. 

The mirror currently displays compliments, important news, the weather, the time and a calendar. 
These basic features give the mirror a elegant look that compliments the stained wood acting as a frame. 
The information is also displayed nearer the edges of the screen allowing for full use of the mirror while still providing the information desired. 
Additional information that is being added currently is a remote control activation that is accessible through a smartphone, a memo module that displays to-do’s and a cryptocurrency tracker that displays individual cryptocurrency values.

The mirror was constructed by first removing the casing from a standard monitor and attaching the two-way mirror to the monitor directly. 
The setup was then framed in wood that had been stained prior to assembly. 
The wood had been cut to length and then a router had been run down the length of the wood to create grooves for the mirror to sit in. 
Due to the nature of the hand-held router the grooves vary in straightness and consistency. 
This could be improved with a table router or a guide for the router. 
Additionally, minor warping in the surface of the mirror is caused by a poor cut to the two-way mirror. This issue is fixed with some minor trimming to the existing setup.
