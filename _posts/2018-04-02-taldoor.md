TalDoor is a hardware redesign of CSH's famous (now severely outdated and unsupported) iButton authentication system. TalDoor is named after our illustrious RA Tal, who was famous for having his door closed at all hours. TalDoor is a complete redesign of the original Gatekeeper system, with the main constraint of maintaining the same physical footprint. 

The two main complaints about the old GateKeeper system are that iButtons are insecure and finding custom power supplies for the hardware is difficult and costly. So when making TalDoor I chose to use the [PocketBeagle]( http://beagleboard.org/pocket) development board. In addition to often returning pictures of cute dogs when Googling the name, the PocketBeagle runs Linux and is powerful enough to support encryption of the ID card data.

To further the security of the system, TalDoor uses the PN532 NFC reader which supports ISO14443A for use with encrypted Mifare DESFire NFC cards. You can read more about NFC and the PN532 [here]( https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pn532-rfid-nfc/about-nfc). ID cards are fairly cheap and can be printed with names, photos, and even the CSH logo.

Because the current GateKeeper system is run from custom 15v power supplies with inverted power/ground lines, finding replacement parts is difficult. Each GateKeeper system also has an Ethernet connection for data. CSH was recently donated gigabit POE network switches that allow for up to 24 watts of power to be drawn from each ethernet port in the network. This means that TalDoor requires only a single ethernet cable for both power and data. At peak operation it uses a mere 3 watts of power which is well within the constraints.

Additionally the main TalDoor PCB has some extra goodies inside. Here is a high level overview of the main components used in TalDoor:

The main PCB which fits exactly where the old GateKeeper board lives in each door lock housing:

|       Main Board          |
|---------------------------|
| PocketBeagle              |
| POE Stepdown Power Supply |
| Ethernet to SPI IC        |
| Door lock motor driver    |
| 3.3v & 5v regulators	    |

There is also an external reader module mounted in an [HID EHRP40-K enclosuse](https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/edge-evo-ehr40-ehrp40-hio-reader-controller.png). This is attached on the outside of the door, where the current iButton reader sits. 

|   External Reader Board   |
|---------------------------|
| PN532 NFC Reader          |
| Red & Green LEDs          |
| Beeper for audio feedback |
