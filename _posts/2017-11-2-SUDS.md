SUDS, or the Shower Use Detection System is a project I did that shows the occupancy status of the showers. There are two LEDs on a panel outside of the bathroom door, that are activated when the a switch on the door lock is pressed, completing the circuit. In addition to illuminating the LED, the current also goes to a GPIO pin, which I will be implementing later as the input to a web app to show the status. Wiring diagrams and other resources can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/sethgower/suds" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.

I made SUDS for the CSH October Hackathon (10/27/17). All in all, during that day I probably put an entire 24 hours into setting up the hardware for the _single_ bathroom. That number includes some time after the Hackathon was over, and then taking into account about 8 hour that I slept during the Hackathon. I will admit that SUDS was not my original idea, it was a project from years ago that just didn't work anymore. The major difference between SUDS v1 and SUDS v2 is the fact that v2 is powered by a MCU (right now it is a Raspberry Pi B2, but will be changing to possibly an Arduino), instead of just a regular circuit driven by 2 AA batteries in the faceplate with the LEDs. This is just the start of SUDS, I am planning on rolling it out to the other bathrooms after I rethink the hardware design. I am planning on using an Arduino with an Ethernet shield so that the Arduino can connect to a server that will run a web app that has more functionality. For the app, I am planning on not only showing the live status of the showers (and possibly toilet stalls), but also generate statistics on how often and at what time the showers/stalls are in use to generate a heat map.
