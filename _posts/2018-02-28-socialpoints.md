description: Socialpoints is a webapp for raking CSHers by their ability to click buttons fast. As a result, socialpoint has become a webapp for making bots that can click faster than everyone elses' bots. Built on flask and based around relational databses.

Socialpoints is a website based around incrementing your own points while decrementing other CSHer's points. Essentially it is a cookie-clicker type game with no real goal other than to increment a counter, but it's a fun thing to play with and a fun project to build.

Socialpoints started out as a joke in the User Center, where we were just talking about how it would be great if there was a point system that could be arbitrarily assigned to CSHers for no reason other than to have points and take those points away. For some reason pretty much everyone in the room was in agreement that this would not only be a great idea, but also cause for a lot of mayhem, and I figured that it was too much fun not to build. 

I started out designing my webapp with the knowledge that if I were to present CSHers with a button that could increment anything, they would take it, write scripts to automate the process, and crash my server. So one of the most important (and time consuming) things I had to do was set a cooldown for the "add points" button to prevent this outcome. 

I ended up learning how to set up a webserver to host the site and how to set up a relational database to store and manage the data in the game, along with sharpening my HTML/Javascript/CSS skills and flask know-how.
